                        a numbered list of your top 3 favorite movies. Your email is also clickable, allowing users to

                    <p>This website is a simple project where you showcase images by linking to them from the web. The
                        task involves selecting 3 images online, copying their URLs, and embedding those links into your
                        webpage. The process allows you to practice working with image URLs and integrating visuals into
                        your site by sourcing images from the internet.</p>

                    <p>This website introduces the concept of using local images in web development. Instead of linking
                        to images hosted externally, it focuses on adding images that are stored directly in the project
                        folder. You start by creating a folder, placing both the HTML file and an image (like
                        "profile.jpg") inside it. By using the `src` attribute in the image tag, you can display the
                        image locally on your webpage. As your project grows, it‚Äôs important to stay organized by
                        creating an "images" folder for better management. This approach helps ensure your images are
                        easily accessible and well-structured within your website.</p>

                    <h1><strong>Three Simple Tables </strong></h1>
                    <p>This website explores how to work with HTML tables. It encourages you to create tables with
                        different content types, such as text, images, or even other tables, all within a single HTML
                        file. The goal is to practice structuring tables using basic attributes like `border="1"` and
                        `width="50%"` to define the layout. Styling will be covered later, so the focus here is on
                        understanding the fundamentals of embedding and organizing content within table cells.</p>

                    <h1><strong>Tables with Rowspan and Colspan </strong></h1>
                    <p>This website focuses on creating tables with advanced HTML features like `rowspan` and `colspan`.
                        It encourages you to recreate two tables: one showcasing company models and another displaying
                        student mark sheets. The challenge is to use `rowspan` to merge rows and `colspan` to merge
                        columns, which allows for more complex and organized table layouts. The emphasis is on
                        practicing how to structure and span data across multiple rows and columns to better present
                        information in tables.</p>

                    <h1><strong>Sign Up and Log In Forms </strong></h1>
                    <p>This website introduces the concept of creating login and registration forms, simulating a basic
                        user authentication flow. You create two pages: one for logging in (`login.html`) and another
                        for signing up (`register.html`). The login page allows users to input their email and password
                        with a link for new users to create an account. The registration page provides a form for
                        entering personal details, including name, email, password, and terms acceptance, with a link
                        for returning users to log in. The project highlights the use of HTML forms, links, and basic
                        user interface components to manage account creation and login processes.</p>

                        incorporating semantic HTML elements. The task involves enhancing the existing code by adding
                        meaningful tags like header, footer, nav, article, section, and more. Additionally, you‚Äôll work
                        on improving accessibility with features like alt attributes for images and meta tags for better
                        SEO and page information. The goal is to make the webpage more organized, accessible, and
